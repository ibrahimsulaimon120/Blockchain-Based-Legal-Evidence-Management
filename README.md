# Blockchain-Based Legal Evidence Management (LegalChain)

## Overview

LegalChain is a secure, immutable platform for managing legal evidence throughout the entire litigation lifecycle. By leveraging blockchain technology, LegalChain ensures the authenticity, integrity, and admissibility of digital evidence while maintaining strict chain of custody controls.

## Key Components

### Case Registration Contract
Establishes and records essential details of legal proceedings on the blockchain.
- Creates unique digital identifier for each case
- Records case metadata (jurisdiction, case type, parties involved)
- Links related cases and proceedings
- Timestamps all case creation and modification events

### Evidence Chain of Custody Contract
Creates an immutable record tracking the handling and transfer of all case materials.
- Records each evidence transfer with timestamp and location data
- Documents every access to evidence items
- Maintains complete chronological history of evidence handling
- Prevents unauthorized modifications to chain of custody records

### Access Control Contract
Manages permissions and authorization for viewing and handling evidence.
- Defines role-based access control for all system users
- Enforces court-ordered access restrictions
- Creates audit trail of all access requests and authorizations
- Supports temporary access grants for expert witnesses and consultants

### Authentication Contract
Validates and verifies the legitimacy of submitted evidence materials.
- Creates cryptographic hash of evidence upon submission
- Verifies digital signatures of evidence submitters
- Documents evidence collection methodologies
- Links to metadata proving authenticity and sourcing

### Retention Contract
Manages the legally required preservation periods for different types of evidence.
- Enforces jurisdiction-specific retention requirements
- Issues notifications for pending evidence disposition
- Documents destruction certificates when retention periods expire
- Implements legal holds to suspend normal retention schedules

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hyperledger Fabric network or compatible enterprise blockchain
- Hardware security modules (recommended for key management)

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/legalchain.git
cd legalchain
npm install
```

### Quick Setup
1. Configure your blockchain network in `config.js`
2. Deploy smart contracts: `npm run deploy`
3. Set up administrative accounts: `npm run initialize-admin`
4. Configure jurisdiction-specific rules: `npm run set-jurisdiction`

## Basic Usage

```javascript
// Initialize LegalChain client
const legalchain = new LegalChain.Client(config);

// Register a new case
const caseId = await legalchain.registerCase({
  caseNumber: "CR-2025-12345",
  jurisdiction: "Northern District of California",
  caseType: "Criminal",
  filingDate: "2025-05-06",
  parties: [
    {role: "Prosecutor", name: "State of California"},
    {role: "Defendant", name: "John Doe"}
  ]
});

// Submit new evidence
const evidenceId = await legalchain.submitEvidence({
  caseId: caseId,
  evidenceType: "Digital",
  description: "Email correspondence between parties",
  submitter: {
    name: "Detective Alex Johnson",
    badgeNumber: "PD-5523",
    department: "Cybercrime Division"
  },
  collectionMethod: "Forensic email extraction",
  collectionDate: "2025-04-28T14:35:22Z",
  hash: "e7d81eab67ea..." // SHA-256 hash of the evidence file
});

// Record chain of custody event
await legalchain.recordCustodyEvent({
  evidenceId: evidenceId,
  fromCustodian: "Detective Alex Johnson",
  toCustodian: "Evidence Room Officer Sarah Williams",
  timestamp: "2025-05-06T09:15:43Z",
  location: "Central Police Department",
  action: "Physical transfer",
  notes: "Sealed in tamper-evident bag #TE-2025-4456"
});
```
